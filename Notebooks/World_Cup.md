# World Cup Prediction Qatar 2022
World Cup has occurred every 4 years since 1930. Many things have change in the game but it is passionate as always. Sports predictions is complicated indeed beacuse they depends in a huge deal of factors even lucky. Hence, I decided to make model using ML to see how well it forecast the result of the games.

Predict game results of each game and winners in every stage.

1. Merge datasets adding useful features (Ranking FIFA).
2. Encode all object variables into numbers.
3. Build models with Random Forest and XGBoost.
