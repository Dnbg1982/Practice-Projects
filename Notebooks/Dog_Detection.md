# Dog Detection Using Neural Networks
Handle unstructured data such as photos is possible using neural networks. In this project tensorflow library was used to build a model which detects breeds of dogs.

GOAL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

DATA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dataset used came from Kaggle dog breed identification competition.
